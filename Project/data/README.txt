This folder contains data for Project 4 for the CSC420 class: http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/teaching/2015/CSC420.html

The directory contains the dataset of DVD cover images in folder DVDcovers. The test images for which you need to discover which DVD they contain are in the test directory. Note that this directory has only a few images. If you have DVDs at home please take (difficult) pictures of them and use them as test images as well. You can add more DVD covers to the DVDcovers folder if you want.

IMPORTANT: This data is for the purpose of this class only. You cannot use it for any other purpose.
